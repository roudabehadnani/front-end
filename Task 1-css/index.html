            <h2>Nordic countries</h2>
            <p id="paragragh">The Nordic countries (also known as the Nordics or Norden)
                are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic.
                It includes the sovereign states of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden;
                the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland; and the autonomous region of Åland.</p>

            <article class="article1">
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>Nordic countries have historically been one of the most socially progressive cultures in
                    the world and culture is one of the main components of cooperation between the Nordic countries.
                    The policies of the Nordic countries with respect to cultural life, mass media and religion have
                    many shared values and features in common. However, some differences may be pointed out and for
                    instance cultural institutions arising from historical circumstances. In both Denmark and Sweden,
                    there are cultural institutions with roots in the traditions of the royal courts.
                    In these countries, national institutions formed the foundation of cultural life at an early
                    stage while in Norway cultural institutions began to form later.</p>
                <p>Iceland has the highest government expenditure on culture, a total of 3.3 per cent of its GDP in
                    2011.
                    Denmark comes second with a total of 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2011. Sweden spend the least in 2011
                    with
                    1.1 per cent. Looking at per capita expenditure, Iceland again has the highest expenditure with
                    Norway coming second. Greenland spends the third highest amount on culture and leisure per capita.
                    In Iceland and Norway, expenditures have more than doubled since 2000. In the other Nordic
                    countries, expenditures have gone up between 40 and 50 per cent in the same period.</p>
                <p>Denmark has the most museums, a total of 274, but museums in Åland and Iceland have the most
                    visitors,
                    an average of 4 and 5 visits per inhabitant. Many theatres in the Nordic countries receive public
                    funding. Theatre funding constitutes a major share of allocations within the cultural area in all
                    the countries. All countries have national theatres, where plays, ballets and operas are performed.
                    In addition to the national theatres, there are professional regional theatres, which are also
                    supported by the state, counties or municipalities. Most countries also have a few private theatres
                    and many amateur ensembles, which may be supported at least partially by municipalities, primarily.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Nordic countries share certain traditions in music, many of which have diverged significantly. In
                    folk music, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Islands share many common aspects.
                    Greenland's Inuit culture has its own musical traditions, influenced by Scandinavian culture.
                    Finland shares many cultural similarities with both the other Nordic countries as well as Estonia.
                    The Sami have their own unique culture, with ties to the neighboring cultures.</p>
                <p>Art music has a strong position in Nordic countries. Apart from state-owned opera houses, there are
                    symphony orchestras in most major cities. The most prominent historical composers from Nordic
                    countries are the Finn Jean Sibelius, the Dane Carl Nielsen and the Norwegian Edvard Grieg. Of
                    contemporary composers, the Finns Magnus Lindberg, Kaija Saariaho and Esa-Pekka Salonen are among
                    the most often performed in the world.</p>
